I am a father and software developer. (I do a few other things, of course, but family and software are what I am most passionate about.) This blog is primarily a place where I can rant without scaring too many people, but occasionally I record things of interest to my family here.

I have been a professional software developer since 1997. I have a deep love of code and passion for software design. I enjoy making computer do what I want but I delight in doing so in an elegant way.
