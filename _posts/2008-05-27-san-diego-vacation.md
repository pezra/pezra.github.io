My family and I are vacationing this week in San Diego. So far it has been pretty much perfect. Weather is really nice, if a bit cool for swimming. Our condo is nice and well located (a block off Mission Beach). The kids like the water, but the sand is where the fun really is as you can tell from the picture above.
