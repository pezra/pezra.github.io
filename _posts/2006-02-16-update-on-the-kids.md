<p class='update'>
  Update: Due to a misconfiguration some of my blog entries from the month of February where recently lost. This is merely a repost of the original content.
</p>

It has been a long time since I posted about the family. Too long, in fact, because a lot has been happening.

<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

Audrey can sit all by herself. She can also roll over (both ways)  
and is trying, unsuccessfully so far, to crawl. This is a fun stage,  
not that another mobile child is really what we need right now. She is  
also a lot more playful and talkative that a couple of weeks ago. It  
seems that when she turned five months old she decided to stop being  
lazy and get some skillz. Just a few Weeks ago she was not very  
interested in rolling, sitting or crawling.

The changes are more gradual at two years than at five months but they are still coming. Elliot talks a lot now. He **loves** the computer, as you can probably tell from the picture. He is especially fond of [Peek-A-Boo with Elmo, Zoe and Big Bird](http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamestreet/games/flash.php?contentId=4203178&)<footnote>Peek-A-Boo game link only works if you have the Flash plugin installed.</footnote> on [Sesame Street&#8217;s](http://www.sesameworkshop.org/) website. Catherine is happy because Elliot finally started calling her &#8220;mama&#8221;.<footnote>Up until a month, or so, ago both she and I were &#8220;daddy&#8221;.</footnote>

It is snowing today, and Elliot loves snow. We had to eat breakfast  
this morning sitting on a stool in the kitchen so that Elliot could  
look out the window and watch the snow. And brushing snow off of the  
cars, now that is _fun_.

Anyway, mostly I just wanted to [show off my kids](http://www.barelyenough.org/apps/gallery/2006), because they are so cute.
