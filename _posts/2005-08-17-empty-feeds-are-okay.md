Yesterday I noticed that there is a [No Fluff Just Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/) stop planned for Denver in November. Then I notice that even though it is listed in the tour stops there is not a page for that stop. In the past this would probably not have bothered me, I mean if they do not have anything useful to say yet why have a page, right? But the other stop specific pages have feeds which means that if the Denver stop had a page I could subscribe to the feed. The fact that the feed would be empty right now is okay. I use an aggregator so I can just ignore it until there is something interesting, like &#8220;registration now open&#8221; for example. As it is I will probably just forget to check the website until December and then I will be disappointed that I missed it.
