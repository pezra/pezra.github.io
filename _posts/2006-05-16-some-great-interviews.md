I have been working my way through [Bruce Eckel&#8217;s collection of software related interviews](http://www.mindviewinc.com/mediacast/interviews/Index.php) recently. A couple of weeks before Mr Eckel posted these I recently realized that I had stopped listening to most of the podcasts to which I subscribe, except for the episodes that were interviews. So when I saw this set of interviews I was quite happy to have a good bit of listening material to ease me into my new car based commute.<footnote>This week I am really glad because \[my local NPR station\](http://www.cpr.org/ &#8220;Colorado Public Radio&#8221;) is having a fundraiser.</footnote>

I have not yet listened to every interview in the set but the ones I have listened to so far are really good. This collection of interviews is many hours of listening but if you can find the time you will not be disappointed.

Today I am listening to [Tim Lister](http://mindview.theunixman.com/05TimLister.mp3) of [Peopleware](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/pw.html) fame. Peopleware is one of those book I have been meaning to read for years but after listening to this interview I think I might start with his newer book [Waltzing with Bears](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/waltz.html) about managing risk on projects. While talking about how most projects are estimated Mr Lister says:

> Someone says &#8220;What&#8217;s the estimate?&#8221; and you say &#8220;38.5 work months&#8221;. I have taken enough statistics to know that the .5 is a joke, and the 8 is a joke and the 3 is a fraud. Other than that 38.5 is perfect.

That pretty much sums up every project estimate I have ever been involved with.
