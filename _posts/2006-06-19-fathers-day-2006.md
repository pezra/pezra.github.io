It was a wonderful day. We did not have any big plans, so I got to play with the kids around the house which was very nice.

Elliot and I went for a short bike ride on [Big Dry Creek Trail](http://www.ci.westminster.co.us/res/rec/default_bdctrail.htm).![Map of Big Dry Creek Trail near my house](http://www.ci.westminster.co.us/images/BDC-trail6.jpg") The creek has water in this time of year and was very pretty. Elliot especially likes to throw sticks into the water and watch them float away.

[Catherine](http://www.barelyenough.org/notablog/) had these really cute shirts made for the kids and facilitated a wonderful day the kids and I. All in all a nearly perfect day.
