My beautiful wife Catherine has started [blogging](http://www.barelyenough.org/notablog/). So far it is mostly about our children. For example, in [Parenthood, part XXVII](http://barelyenough.org/notablog/2006/03/31/i-had-to-say-what/)

> &#8220;It goes without saying &#8211; but, don&#8217;t let Elliot lick his underwear.&#8221;

But in addition to being a nearly perfect mother Catherine is also an extremely talented database architect so you might see a few technical tidbits from her occasionally.
