For any tech people in the Denver/Boulder area I wanted to point out that there is a [BrainJam unconference](http://brainjam.info) happening this Friday (April 11th). Looks like a lot very interesting people have signed up so far, and I will be attending, so I have high expectations. If you are able to join us find me and say &#8220;hi&#8221;.
