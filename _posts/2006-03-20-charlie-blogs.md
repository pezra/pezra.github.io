[Charles Savage](http://cfis.savagexi.com) has [started a blog](http://cfis.savagexi.com/articles/2006/03/18/some-title). Finally. I worked with, and for, him at Smallworld, and then General Electric. He is wicked smart and usually a bit ahead of the curve. I definitely look forward to hearing more of what he has to say.
