Ruben Verborgh has an [piece on the how to move the semantic web forward](http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2014/05/29/the-pragmantic-web/).

> [&#8230;] if you hosted a Web application, would you offer (even read-only) direct SQL access to your database? Of course you wouldn't; this would pose a serious threat to the stability of your server. And, it's not needed: you design your HTTP interface such that all data can be easily accessedâ€”but you decide how!
>
> We've been thinking of such HTTP interfaces that are handy to query Linked Data datasets. So the server still decides how clients access dataâ€”just like on the Web for humans or applicationsâ€”but this time in RDF. We designed one such interface that consists of basic Linked Data Fragments, which offer triple-pattern-based access to a dataset. Servers can easily generate such fragments, and clients can use them to solve more complex queries themselves. So simple servers, smart clients.

Preach it, brother!
