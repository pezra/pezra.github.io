The kids insisted I take this photo of the &#8220;pretty pineapple things&#8221; in front of our hotel. Why are we in a hotel? It is the kids and my annual over night hotel stay due to Catherine putting he &#8220;no boys and no kids!&#8221; sign on the club house. The kids love staying at hotels so no complaints from them.
