There is big news from the work front, [SystemShepherd 5.0](http://www.absolute-performance.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=77&Itemid=219) has been released. This is what I work on day-to-day and it is great to see it finally officially released.

SystemShepherd is a seriously cool bit of software designed to help you manage your software-as-a-service offering more effectively. If you have a system that you need to manage better you owe it to yourself to check it out.
