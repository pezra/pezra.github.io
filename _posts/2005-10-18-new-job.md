I have managed to get a paying [<acronym title='Ruby on Rails'>RoR</acronym>](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) job! Yay! (Thanks, Donnie.)

While I was looking for a job this time I was surprised by the demand for dynamic language skills. There are still a lot more jobs doing static languages but there are a few companies in the Denver area that use languages you can love (like Ruby and Python). This is much nicer than the last time I was looking when the only choices were Java and C++ (with a few .net jobs here and there). It feels like dynamic languages are gaining some serious ground lately and I am extremely happy to be part of that trend.
