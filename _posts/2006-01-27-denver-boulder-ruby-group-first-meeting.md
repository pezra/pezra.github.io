As it turns out I was able to make to the Denver-Boulder Ruby Group<footnote>Or is it Colorado Ruby Enthusiasts (CORE)?</footnote> meeting last night (thanks for putting it together Marty). It was a stunning success as far as I am concerned. There were, easily, 30 people in attendence, which is quite a bit more than I anticipated. Last night was basically a meet and greet for the Ruby enthusiasts in the area, which I think is perfect for a first meeting.

Planning for the second meeting is already started (apparently it will included some presentations) so if you missed this one you&#8217;ll have another chance fairly soon.
