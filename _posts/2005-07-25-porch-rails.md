Last week-end I replaced the hand rails on my front porch. The new ones are Severe Weather Pre-Finished Composite Railing. They come as kit with everything you need, are very easy to install and, as you can see, they look really nice. (And best of all, they require no maintenance.)

There is something so satisfying about finishing a project. Especially when it makes a big difference in the way your house looks.
