The worst is over at my parents house and they are fine. No damage to their house and none of the downed trees need to be dealt with immediately (they are not in road, etc). I am pretty amazed that their telephone is still working. Apparently, they talked to my brother not too long ago and he is fine.

When I tried to call my brother on his mobile phone I got this message, &#8220;Due to the hurricane in the area your call cannot be completed at this time.&#8221; I think it is a pretty interesting that the &#8220;your call cannot be completed&#8221; messages are customized these days.
