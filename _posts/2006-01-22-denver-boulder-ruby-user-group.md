On the off chance there is a Rubyist in the Denver area that did not notice this before me I want to point out that a [Ruby Users Group is being formed](http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=5222). First meeting is on Thursday (Jan 26) in Boulder. I don&#8217;t think I will be able to make it (prior engagement) but hopefully it will be a good group.
