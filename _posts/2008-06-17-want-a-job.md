As you have probably noticed, I recently started a new job. Which means that I also recently left a job.

The job I left was as at [Absolute Performance](http://absolute-performance.com), and it was a pretty good gig. The good news is that my leaving means that [there is a spot for you](http://www.absolute-performance.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=99&Itemid=288#Ruby). If you are interested in working on some cool Ruby, Java and C++ code with a really great team you should send them a resume. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to tell them I sent you, maybe they will buy me a lunch or something.
