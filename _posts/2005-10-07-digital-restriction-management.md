David Berlind [explains why DRM is so dangerous](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1966).

<blockquote cite='http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1966'>
  <p>
    Copyright holders are certainly entitled to charge what they want for their music and let the market decide, and if the content is good enough and the price is right, I&#8217;m happy to pay. But, judging by reality (how DRM is being used), DRM&#8217;s goal apparently doesn&#8217;t stop there. Instead of managing my fair use rights to the content I&#8217;m paying for, it&#8217;s restricting them. Thus, the R in DRM is really for Restrictions, not Rights.

He goes on to describe how DRM leads a technological monoculture and how that monoculture negatively affects both content consumers and producers. I decided a while ago that I would never own an iPod, because I refused to conspire against my peers, children and self by paying Apple money to be evil. However, Mr Berlind does a much better job defending my choice than I ever have.
