The [Rocky Mountain Blogger Bash](http://rockymountainblogs.com/) is tonight and I will be there. [Cat](http://pinkasparag.us/) and I are even on the official RSVP list (which means we get free drinks). This is my only concession to the [convention](http://www.denverconvention2008.com/) but any gathering of &#8220;beer-swigin&#8217;&#8221; bloggers has to be fun. If you are going too let me know and I will keep an eye out for you.
