It is autumn in Denver. As I look out my office window I see mountains with snow on them behind the foothills bathed in the particular golden light of autumn. It is a gorgeous view. I love this time of year.

I have seriously considered taking up smoking again since fall arrived. There are very few things more enjoyable than having a smoke in the autumn breeze while looking at the mountains. It has been over a year since I quit. Most of the time I don&#8217;t miss it but this time of year&#8230;

The only thing that keeps me from starting is that I don&#8217;t think I would want to quit at the end of autumn. Smoking in the snow is really nice, too. I wonder if I will feel this way every autumn?

If you need me I will be outside&#8230;
