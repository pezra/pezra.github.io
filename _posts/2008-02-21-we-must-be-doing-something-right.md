Yesterday while Elliot, Audrey and I were walking through [DFW](http://www.dfwairport.com/)<sup id='d5f45a63b7cee5b3d99ca461a5a2231281cf29dffnref:1'><a href='#d5f45a63b7cee5b3d99ca461a5a2231281cf29dffn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> Elliot &#8211; he is 4 years old &#8211; asked me, &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;

&#8220;Concourse C, but I am not sure which gate yet<sup id='d5f45a63b7cee5b3d99ca461a5a2231281cf29dffnref:2'><a href='#d5f45a63b7cee5b3d99ca461a5a2231281cf29dffn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.&#8221;, I said.

&#8220;Daddy, is it C dot com or C and some other letters?&#8221;, Elliot asked in reply.

        Which, I must say, is really a pretty nice airport these days. I have not been there since late last century, when I was traveling a lot for work. At that time, it was the airport in the US which I loathed the most.

            A two hour layover has it&#8217;s disadvantages, but when one adult is traveling with two children it is well worth it.
