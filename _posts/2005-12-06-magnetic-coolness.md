These look like some cool [magnetic toys](http://www.unitednuclear.com/magnets.htm).<footnote>Via [Evilsoft.org](http://www.evilsoft.org/?p=51).</footnote> Notice the warning about breaking bones? Makes you want to buy one just to find out if they really are that powerful. Super strong magnets do sound fun but I think my favorite is the MagnaView Fluid (below), which conforms to magnetic fields so that you can see them.
