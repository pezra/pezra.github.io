Sean McGrath has an interesting [view](http://www.itworld.com/Tech/2987/nls_ebizmediators050429/index.html) of EAI. Basically he thinks is all about dispute resolution.

> Computer system A sees the world one way, computer system B sees the world another way, computer system C has a third way and thinks A and B are deeply wrong in how they see the world. etc. etc. The custodians of systems A, B and C need to work together for the good of the greater organization.

That fits pretty well with my experience.
