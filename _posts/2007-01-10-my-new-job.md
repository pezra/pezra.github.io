I have been at my new job for just over a month now so I suppose it is time to post something about it. I joined [Absolute Performance](http://absolute-performance.com) at the end of November. We do &#8220;operations management solutions&#8221; which is marketing speak for helping you &#8211; both reactively and proactively &#8211; keep your applications, and systems, available and meeting [SLAs](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Level_Agreement).

I am back to developing in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) which makes me immensely happy. The technology around here is a mix of C++ and Ruby but my primary role is working on the browser based front-end for our monitoring infrastructure. That means I spend the vast majority of my time in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). It has been a great pleasure moving back into [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) after being exiled into [PHP](http://php.net), on which really cannot be overstated.

With the new job I expect my posting frequency to pick up a little. At my previous company there turned out to be some concerns about my some of my posts. That really took the joy out of posting, and therefore reduced the number precipitously. I look forward to working my way back to something like my peak frequency.
