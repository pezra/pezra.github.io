[YubNub](http://yubnub.org/) is very cool. It is basically a command line for the web. For example, you can say &#8220;define good&#8221; and it returns a web page with the definition. Even better you can define new commands. I just defined a new command, lexfn, which finds a set of words that are related to the one you provide. (I find this particularly useful when trying to come up with names for classes and methods.) So go and add some cool commands.
