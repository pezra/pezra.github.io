This weekend Elliot, Audrey and I and went for a hike on [Fowler Trail](http://parks.state.co.us/Parks/EldoradoCanyon/Trails/)<sup id='b83539c95fb8d479e30743a43a97ba34d0495fb5fnref:1'><a href='#b83539c95fb8d479e30743a43a97ba34d0495fb5fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. As always Elliot was playing with sticks along the way. At some point he showed me a stick and said, &#8220;look Daddy, it&#8217;s a gun&#8221;. I replied, &#8220;Oh, OK&#8221;. I am not a bit fan of gun play, but I realize that it is inevitable so I just try not to make a big deal out of it. Elliot was, predictably, completely unfazed by my lack of enthusiasm and continued playing with his &#8220;gun&#8221;.

At about the one mile mark the trail leaves Eldorado Canyon State Park and there is a sign with several icons indicating what is and isn&#8217;t allowed on the trail past that point. Elliot asked me what the sign said, so I told him, &#8220;it says no dogs, no camping, no fires and no guns&#8221;. Elliot immediately says, &#8220;oh&#8221; and drops the stick gun right there in the middle of the trail.

        Fowler Trail is a nice tail for hiking with kids. It is an easy trail with some great views.
