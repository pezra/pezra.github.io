You should read this [ABC article on &#8220;Operation Northwoods&#8221;](http://abcnews.go.com/US/print?id=92662) if you have ever thought that any government can be trusted. Basically, it boils down to a plan by the US military to attack the US and blame it on Cuba so that there would be public support for an invasion of Cuba. And Operation Northwoods was not the only &#8220;pretext&#8221; plan. The most disturbing part is that it took 40 years for the story to come out.

We need a _much_ more transparent government. Until that happens, just remember this story the next time you are told that a war is necessary and wonder it if _really is_.
