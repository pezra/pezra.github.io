Elliot has started to grasp grammar. This week-end he started constructing his own sentences. Previously he had only been repeating phrases that he had heard us say. Now he seems to grasp that a phrase is a series of composable words, rather than just one long word. Which is good because he does have a lot to say lately, not that anyone except Catherine and I can understand most of it.
