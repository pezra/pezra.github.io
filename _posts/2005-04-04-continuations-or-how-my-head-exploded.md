Occasionally I find a new idea and wonder how I lived so long without encountering it before. Continuations are one of those ideas. I have been hearing about them for a few months but only recently have I started to understand them. They have been around for a long time and can solve problems that a difficult or impossible to solve otherwise. Of course, continuations are not supported in the in-vogue languages so that is probably how I missed them.

Anyway, here are some links to a couple of tutorials (thanks Charlie). A [gentle introduction](http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?Continuations) and a [not-so gentle description of external iterators, called generators, in ruby](http://www.all-thing.net/Ruby/iterators_generators_and_continuations_in_ruby.html). If those articles do not humble you a little I am impressed.
