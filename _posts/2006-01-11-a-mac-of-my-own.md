I have never really been drawn to the Mac the way many of my peers seem to be. I am very happy with [Ubuntu](http://ubuntulinux.org/) and could really not see any reason why I would move off of such a nice platform.

My boss, [Donald Marino](http://donaldmarino.blogspot.com)<footnote>Donnie is a card carrying koolaid drinker, by which I mean he has a mac.com email address.</footnote>, had other plans, and has ordered PowerBooks<footnote>The old G4 machines, not the new MacBooks.</footnote> for all the developers where we work. Donnie did offer to let me keep my Linux box but after throwing my back out lugging my Dell XPS<footnote>I inherited this box from a previous employee. It is very fast, has a great screen (though the reflectivity is annoying most of the time) and an arbitrarily large hard drive. Unfortunately, it weighs as much as the desktop for which it is a replacement.</footnote> back and forth to work a few times I decided to try this Mac thing. At the very least it will hurt my back less.

I find my self a little sad to leave Linux, even though my new machine will probably not arrive for weeks. I am consoling myself with the fact that I will have a nice BSD machine underneath the slightly garish GUI. I really have no doubt that I will find the Mac a fine place to work, once I get use to it. Many people that I respect claim that the Mac is a great place to develop software. But I still feel a bit like lemming.
