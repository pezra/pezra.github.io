Today Elliot reached a huge milestone. He discovered tree climbing. This afternoon Elliot was playing in the back yard while I was busy preparing dinner. After being outside a while Elliot ran inside and said very excitedly, &#8220;I was sitting in the tree.&#8221;

This is huge. I had wondered a few months ago &#8211; about the time Elliot figured out how to hide in a different place during hide and seek &#8211; when he would start climbing trees. I have such fond memories of climbing trees as a child and I think he will too. He spent the next two hours, until bed time, climbing that tree pretty much non-stop.
