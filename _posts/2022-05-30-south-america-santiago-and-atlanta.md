I was booked to fly from Denver to Santiago with a short layover in Atlanta. However, my flight from Denver was slightly delayed so i miss the Santiago leg and had to spend 24 hours in Atlanta (there is only one flight to Santiago per day). This turned out to be really nice. I took the opportunity to visit the [Martin Luther King Jr National Historical Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._National_Historical_Park). It was a Sunday so the museum, etc were closed but it is a interesting neighborhood to walk around.

After that i headed to the nearby [Piedmont Park](https://piedmontpark.org). There was a Jazz festival happening so I lazed about the park listening to [Joe Alterman](https://www.joealtermanmusic.com) and some other artists that escape my memory until it was time to head the airport. All in all it was a great way to spend an unexpected visit to Atlanta.

Then i was on to Santiago. My flight arrived early the next morning so i connected with Joshua and Sophia and we started exploring Santiago starting with the Plaza de Armas.

Santiago is covered in beautiful street art which makes wandering around a real treat.

We ended the day watching a beautiful sunset from [San Cristóbal Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Cristóbal_Hill).
