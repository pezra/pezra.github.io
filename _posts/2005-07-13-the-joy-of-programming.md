The last couple of days I have been working on a little tool written in PHP, HTML and CSS. It is your basic, simple data-driven web application. Nothing particularly technically challenging, but it was unbelievably fun to write.

After using Java almost exclusively for the last several months I had forgotten just how much fun it is to write code in a really productive environment. (That usually means one that you can use reasonably well without 100 megs worth of IDE.) There are quite a few things about PHP which I think is less than optimal or elegant but you can get so much done in such a short time that those issues really just don&#8217;t matter.
