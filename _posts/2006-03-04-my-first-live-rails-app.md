My very first Rails app went live today. The project had a very tight  
deadline and we managed to go live only three days late which, in my  
book, is on time. Interestingly, this is the very first application  
that I have deployed live on the Internet. Prior to this all my web  
application experience came from working on a web application  
framework. That was interesting work but it is a bit little different  
feeling when someone else actually does the deployment on their  
hardware, data and application code. I like this feeling of having  
accomplished something &#8220;real&#8221;, for lack of a better word. I think that  
feeling of realness come from the fact that this app solves an actual  
business problem and that is available to the public.

I have learned a lot in the last couple of weeks. I might blog about  
some of the in more depth at some point in the future but I want to get  
some things off my chest before I forget them.

  * Ruby on Rails &#8212; After doing a project from start to  
    deployment I still think it is really nice. It&#8217;s fast to develop in an  
    overall a really solid platform. I still don&#8217;t like those URIs, though.
  * Lighttpd &#8212; Seems reasonably fast and solid once you get it configured but the  
    documentation is teh suck. Many fairly important configuration options  
    are not even mentioned in the documentation. And that configuration  
    language leaves a lot to be desired. On the other hand I am comparing  
    it to Apache, which is a tough act to follow as far as easy of use and  
    documentation go .
  * CSS &#8212; Sweet. Absolutely brilliant. But how on earth did we get to version 3 and still not have a parent pseudo class?
  * JavaScript &#8212; This is a very nice little language. Really nice semantics. Would be  
    nicer if it did not have those ugly curly braces all over the place,  
    but if you skip the semi-colons (and they are, in fact, optional in  
    most situations) the code can look half decent.
  * IE &#8212; That annoying other browser that really, absolutely work. I know that  
    complaining about IE incompatibilities is passÃ© but how are child  
    selectors not supported?
  * Firefox &#8212; What can I say&#8230; Get it, use it, love it.
  * Commuting by bus &#8212; No matter what is going on you are guaranteed 1 hour of sleep each day. Priceless.

Over all the technology stack is really nice. There are a few rough  
edges here and there but it is eminently workable and the experience of  
building an app with the set of technologies is mostly about building  
the app, not about spend excessive amounts of time learning the  
infrastructure.
