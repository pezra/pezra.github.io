David Chappell [declares the REST vs WS-* war over](http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/06/rest-vs-ws-war-is-over-if-you-want-it.html)

> To anybody who&#8217;s paying attention and who&#8217;s not a hopeless partisan, the war between REST and WS-* is over. The war ended in a truce rather than crushing victory for one side&#8211;it&#8217;s Korea, not World War II. The now-obvious truth is that both technologies have value, and both will be used going forward.

In this conflict I am, undeniably, a REST partisan. I know this colors my perceptions, but it is not obvious to me that the war is over. It has become obvious that WS-\* will not prevail, but that does not mean it is over. Those who have invested a great deal of time and thought into WS-\* may hope that it remains a viable technology, at least for certain problems, but that does not mean it will. I think the situations for which WS-* is the best available technology are vanishingly rare, perhaps even nonexistent. As Mark Baker puts it in his [response to Mr Chappell](http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2007/07/03/crud-more-crud-crud/)

> Perhaps David &#8211; or anybody else &#8211; could point me towards a data oriented application which can&#8217;t fit (well) into such a model (not REST, just the uniform interface part).

I expect that when all is said and done WS-* will still be around. But rather than as a vibrate technology platform, the way Mr Chappell seems to anticipate, I think it survive in a way far more like the way Cobol is still around today: as a zombie, unkillable and ready to eat the brain of anyone who wanders too close the legacy systems.
