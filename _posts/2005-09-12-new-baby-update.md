It has been a busy couple of weeks since I last posted. Audrey is doing great. She is a very easy baby. It seems that she and Elliot share a low key, go with the flow, temperament. (Hopefully I am not speaking too soon.) Catherine and I were a little worried that we might have used all those genes up with Elliot. Audrey is already sleeping 4-5 hour stretches at night, most nights, which is great for a baby her age.

Elliot seems so big now. Before Audrey was born he was a baby (or, at least, a very little boy). I suppose it is all a matter of perspective. Now that I compare him to a real baby is seems obvious that he is is not one anymore.
