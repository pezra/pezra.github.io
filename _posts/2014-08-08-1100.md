While at the national portrait gallery Audrey was looking pretty underwhelmed by all the beautiful portraits. All of a sudden she perks up at says &#8220;look, there&#8217;s a picture of a dog!&#8221; and scoots off across the room. Later she commented that &#8220;this museum doesn&#8217;t have very many interesting pictures. Only a few of them have animals and they&#8217;re just sitting next to the person.&#8221;
