Day 2 is a big rapids day. It was cool this morning and the water is below 50 degrees so we really appreciated our splash jackets.

We stop for a hike up north canyon, a gorgeous slot canyon. At the pool Megan and Leia gave us a wonderful little guitar and vocal concert. The acoustics of the pool are amazing.

Dinner was salmon, quinoa and fruit salad. It was delicious, though a little sandy. The wind was pretty strong during dinner prep.

It rained off and on over night but i rested well wrapped in a tarp. Wet is way better than hot. We don&#8217;t need no stinken&#8217; tents. (Though they are provided for those who feel otherwise.) Word to the wise it is a _lot _cooler near the water.
