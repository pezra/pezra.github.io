I have been at my new job for a little over a week now. Everything is still new and shiny but so far I am loving it. The small size of the team and simplicity of the environment mean that, even in my second week, I am able to make some real contributions<footnote>I wonder if I will still think that these are real contributions in a few months?</footnote>. This is the first job I have ever had that I have actually written real code in the first week on the job.

I am still getting comfortable with Rails but I can see why it has the buzz it does. The speed with which we are creating an initial pass at the application is pretty impressive, especially since everyone on the team is learning Rails as we go.
