My wife and I found out the gender of our new baby on Saturday. It is a girl! We were suppose to find out at a scheduled prenatal visit on Monday but the baby was uncooperative. My wife is a planner so not knowing what the gender was not really an option (and I was curious, too). So, we went to one of those commercial ultrasound places and they were able to identify the gender with no problem.
