Paul Graham has a new essay, [Hiring is Obsolete](http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html). As usual it is quite insightful, though perhaps just a little self serving in light of his latest [venture](http://ycombinator.com/).

I feel just a bit disappointed when I read about other people&#8217;s experiences related to founding startups. Now that I have a family the risk founding a startup is too high. I wonder how much wealth would be generated if I did not have to risk my family&#8217;s health and well-being to be involved in a startup. Until then founding startups will remain &#8212; primarily, at least &#8212; domain of the young (or rich).

Regardless of what your emotional reaction is to universal health care and a social safety net, there is no denying that they would reduce the risk of founding a startup. I think that risk reduction would be a massive boost to the economy. It would allow anyone with a good idea to pursue it without having to worry about what would happen if your child gets sick, etc. Unfortunately, it would be at the short-term expense of entrenched interests (read: owners of congress people) so things are not likely to change anytime soon.
