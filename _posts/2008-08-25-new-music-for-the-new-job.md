I started my new gig, at [brightkite](http://brightkite.com), today. I am super stoked to be working with the excellent crew there.

I realized that I need some new music, though. I have quite a lot of music that I associate strongly with particular events, workplaces, teams and even books<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. My tastes range from pop with a decent beat, to dub, to pretty much anything involving a piano. For example, recently have been listening to [Silversun Pickups](http://www.amazon.com/Carnavas-Silversun-Pickups/dp/B000FUF86Q) (thanks to [Donnie](http://donaldmarino.com/archives/63)), [Ben Folds](http://www.amazon.com/Supersunnyspeedgraphic-LP-Ben-Folds/dp/B000I2KNUC), [Burial](http://www.amazon.com/Untrue-Burial/dp/B000WTBMBK), and [Pitch Black](http://www.pitchblack.co.nz/?s1=albums&s2=Rude%20Mechanicals). But most of my music library is already saturated with emotion. I need some new music.

So I am ask you, my readers, for some suggestions of some new music I can associate with my new gig. Point me at some your favorite music.

        You really could not find a better sound track to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy'>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a> than <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Version-2-0-Garbage/dp/B000006NZV'>Garbage 2.0</a>. That album was the one on my <a href='http://www.antiqueradio.com/Dec04_Menta_mp3pt1.html'>Nomad</a> (see figure 5 in the linked page) when I started reading it and two went together so well I stuck with it for the entire book.
