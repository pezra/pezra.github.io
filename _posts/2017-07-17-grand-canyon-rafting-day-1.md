We put in at Lee&#8217;s Ferry. We learn the few commands the guides use right away and then we are off.

The scenery is awe inspiring right from the beginning (as you can see from the background).

Lunch is a short break from the river.  The crew sets up an impressive buffet of sandwich makings and snacks. As soon as everyone is done eating the table and food is stowed and we are back on the river.

We ran 4 small to medium rapids (badger creek, soap creek, 13 mile and sheer wall) on the first day. Unfortunately, i don&#8217;t have any pictures or video of the rapids due to needing to have both hands on the paddle during rapids and an issue with Elliot&#8217;s go pro, which i will cover in a later post.

    A little light reading (&#8220;Death in Grand Canyon&#8221;) while dinner is being prepared.

Dinner is steak, mash potatoes and salad. It is seriously excellent.

We sleep on the beach under the stars &#8212; well clouds strictly speaking . It was super hot and there were lots bugs so it is a rather fitful night. Later i learn that wetting the provided liner (a sleeping bag made out of light weight cotton fabric) and sleeping in that is the suggested way of cooling down and keeping the bugs off. Live and learn.
