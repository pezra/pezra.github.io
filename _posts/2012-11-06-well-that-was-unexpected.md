I am no longer with GitHub. Working at GitHub was a pretty amazing experience. I enjoyed every single minute of it except for the last half hour or so.

However, impermanence is &#8212; so i am back on the market. If you need someone who knows a fair bit about web API design, SOA (of the REST flavor), Ruby and web applications check out [my resume](http://barelyenough.org/resume/) and ping me. I&#8217;d love to chat about opportunities.
