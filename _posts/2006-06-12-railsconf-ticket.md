I am not going to be able to attend [RailsConf](http://railsconf.org) this year. That means I have one RailsConf ticket I would like to sell at face value ($400 US). I also have a conference rate ($100/night) hotel reservation for June 22-26 at the Wyndham O&#8217;Hare that I will transfer to whomever buys the ticket. If you are intetest please email me at <pezra@barelyenough.org>.
