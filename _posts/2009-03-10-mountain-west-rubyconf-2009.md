I going to [Mountain West RubyConf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/) this weekend. I am very excited. Last year this was a great conference and [the schedule](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/schedule) looks great this year too. If you are going to be there too let me know. One of the great things about these conferences is all the great people you get to meet, so hopefully i&#8217;ll see you there.
