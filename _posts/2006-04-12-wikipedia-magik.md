I am regularly amazed by what ends up on the Internet. Today&#8217;s example is [this Wikipedia article about the Magik programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magik_programming_language).<footnote>Via  
\[Charlie Savage\](http://cfis.savagexi.com)</footnote> Magik is a proprietary language developed by a company call Smallworld, which was later acquired by GE. I worked in the Magik programming language for six years and it is easily the second best language I have ever worked with professionally ([Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) is the best language I have worked with). I am just amazed that it has a Wikipedia page.
