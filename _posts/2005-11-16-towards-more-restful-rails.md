Dan Kubb has created a [Ruby on Rails controller supports RESTful interfaces](http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2005-November/000042.html)<footnote>Via [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/11/16/RESTful-Rails)</footnote> more directly than the current controller does.
