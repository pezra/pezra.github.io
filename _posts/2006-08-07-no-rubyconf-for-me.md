Last week I was on vacation and did not touch a computer for six days. That was nice except that the organizers of [RubyConf](http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/)<sup id='337e6411342cc3404bb2dbb397c13c4f12641373fnref:1'><a href='#337e6411342cc3404bb2dbb397c13c4f12641373fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> choose that week to open registration for RubyConf 2006. It [sold out the first day](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/3/rubyconf-selling-fast)<sup id='337e6411342cc3404bb2dbb397c13c4f12641373fnref:2'><a href='#337e6411342cc3404bb2dbb397c13c4f12641373fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>, of course. That means that I am not going to RubyConf this year, even though it is being held within driving distance of my house. I guess I can live vicariously through the blogs of people who are going.

Anyway, if anyone reading this is going and would like to meet up and have a beer while you are in Denver send me an email.

        By the way, if you go to just plain <a href='http://rubyconf.com'>rubyconf.com</a> you get the RubyGems home page rather than the RubyConf page.

            I do have to say that 200-ish seats is an absurdly small number of seats for a conference on such a hot topic. Not that is would have helped me, I missed registration by days.
