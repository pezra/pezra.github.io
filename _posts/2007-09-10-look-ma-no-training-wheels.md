On Saturday, after riding around with the other kids on our block for a bit, Elliot rode up to the porch and asked me, &#8220;make my bike into a two wheeler, please&#8221;. I happily obliged and since then he has spent every minute we will let him on his bicycle.

This is the second time the training wheels have been off his bike. The last time Catherine and I initiated it and Elliot was riding unassisted within minutes. However, the next day he did not want to ride his bike. After a couple of days we managed to get him to tell us why he was not riding his bike. &#8220;Because I am scared of falling down&#8221;, he said. So we put the training wheels back on and he was back riding his bike as happily as ever.

Now, apparently, he has not such fear. He has become a very capable bike rider in just a few hours.
