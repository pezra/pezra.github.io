I had a lot of fun at the [Denver Tech Meetup](http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/001037.html) last night. I was really great to meet some new people from around the area. [Alex](http://www.alexking.org) [thinks this is going to be a bi-monthly event](http://www.alexking.org/blog/2005/10/13/denver-tech-meetup/) and I hope he is right.

Thanks for putting this meetup together (and for the beer and pizza) [Steve](http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/).
