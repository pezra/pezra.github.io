I recently started feeling a bit like [Joey deVilla did before he changed jobs](http://www.joeydevilla.com/2007/11/25/assrockets-and-opportunities-or-why-i-changed-jobs/). I was way too comfortable and needed some real challenges to drive my career and personal development forward. That combined with my long standing<sup id='4c0830dec7af5679b857d857d55796c45a9e8d7afnref:1'><a href='#4c0830dec7af5679b857d857d55796c45a9e8d7afn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> envy of those lucky people involved in startups lead me to explore the startup scene in Boulder<sup id='4c0830dec7af5679b857d857d55796c45a9e8d7afnref:2'><a href='#4c0830dec7af5679b857d857d55796c45a9e8d7afn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>. Now that exploration has paid off.

I have accepted a position on the technical staff of [Gnip](http://gnipcentral.com). I will be joining [Eric Marcoullier](http://www.marcoullier.com/blog/) and [Jud Valeski](http://one.valeski.org/) in their efforts to create a compelling bit of web infrastructure. (I will be more forth coming in near future, I promise.) I can&#8217;t wait to tackle the challenges this opportunity is going to present.

        And I do mean long standing. Pretty much since my first programming gig at an established firm, in the midst of the dot com bubble, 10 years ago.

            There are more startups than you can shake a stick at in Boulder these days. In the Denver metro area this is where the action is.
