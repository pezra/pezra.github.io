  &lt;h4&gt;Rating: &lt;span class="rating"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; out 5&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p class="description"&gt;I finally got around to trying out this &lt;abbr class="type" title="business"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse" rel="tag"&gt;coffee house&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothie" rel="tag"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; shop&lt;/abbr&gt; located in the Westminster Promenade next to the Sun Ice Centre.  My &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americano" rel="tag"&gt;americano&lt;/a&gt; was quite tasty.  It was a little too hot, and a bit more character would not have killed it, but it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a good cup of coffee.  The menu included the usual variety of coffee and tea based refreshments one expects from a coffee house.  Jumpin'; Juice & Java also servers a variety of smoothies which looked good, but I did not try one so I cannot comment directly. The ambiance was warm and inviting, with large windows, comfortable looking leather couches and a gas fire place.  A sign on the door claimed that wifi was available.  I can definitely imagine my self hanging out there this winter and drinking espresso and watching the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
