The [Subtext programming language](http://subtextual.org) looks like a interesting bit of work. The [demo](http://subtextual.org/demo1.html)<footnote><span class='via'>Via <a href='http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/subtext-presentation.html'>Brian McCallister</a></span></footnote> of subtext in action is well worth watching. I am definitely intrigued by the idea of hypothetical programing since I already program that way except that I run the hypothetical scenarios in my head.
