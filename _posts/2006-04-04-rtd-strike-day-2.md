This is day two of the [<acronym title='Regional Transportation District'>RTD</acronym>](http://rtd-denver.com) [strike](http://denverpost.com/news/ci_3666799). That means that today is my second day of commuting to downtown Denver by car. Commuting by car is so much less civilized that riding the bus.

Catherine and I have rearranged our schedules so that I can leave the house earlier than I usually would. That seems to let me find parking for about $8 per day. That is expensive but a lot less than the $20 I paid yesterday.

Anyway, if there is anyone reading this that commutes into downtown along the US-36 corridor let me know and maybe we can carpool. The <acronym title='High Occupancy Vehicle'>HOV</acronym> lanes definitely move faster.
