It is autumn here in Denver. The light has changed. The last couple of days have been really cool and crisp. This morning there was snow on the mountains. This is, by far, my favorite time of year. This year, though, I feel like I am missing autumn, a bit. I stopped smoking two and a half months ago so I am going outside a lot less often. I know I could go outside when ever I want but I rarely do.

[I am not the only one appreciating autumn in Denver. [btw, thanks]](http://www.dizzyd.com/blog/?p=76)
