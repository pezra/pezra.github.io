Well, my [house](http://www.recolorado.com/Search/propertyDetail.asp?mls_number=330072#) is [on](http://www.realtor.com/FindHome/HomeListing.asp?frm=byxmls&xlid=1056577520&poe=realtor) the [market](http://www.coloproperty.com/Reports/index.cfm?Action=DetailReport&MLSNumber=483641); there&#8217;s no turning back now.

I am really going to miss this house. It is a great house it is just does not quite fit my family anymore. This house was perfect for us when we bought it. It is in a nice neighborhood within easy commuting distance of Interlocken, Denver and Boulder and we had quite a bit of room to grow.

Now we have two young children, one boy and one girl, and we want three bedrooms on the same floor so that the kids do not have to share a room. We have found a another house we like and have made an offer on it. This other house is a great fit for us but I think it will be a long time before I feel about it the way I do about our current house.
