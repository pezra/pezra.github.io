A few months ago I pointed a colleague at [XUL](http://xulplanet.com/) as a way to implement a user interface without requiring local installation. After doing a bit of research he mentioned the[Mozilla Amazon Browser](http://www.faser.net/mab/chrome/content/mab.xul) to me. I have been intrigued by the idea of XUL and XAML since I first encountered them but MAB is the first XUL application I have actually used. It is not terribly polished but it gives you the feeling that a XUL application could be extremely slick.
