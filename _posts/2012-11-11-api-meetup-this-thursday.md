We are having an API meetup at [Lucky Pie in Louisville, CO](http://luckypiepizza.com/louisville/) on nov 15th @ 6:30pm. Come share a tasty beverage, a slice of pizza and your opinions on all things API with your fellow [API crafters](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft). If you are an API practitioner we&#8217;d love to meet you in person.

BTW, if you are in Denver for [Defrag](http://www.defragcon.com/2012/) this drinkup is a short drive from the Omni Interlocken so please join us.

If you [register](http://api-craft-denver.eventbrite.com/) it&#8217;ll help ensure we have enough space, but all are welcome, registered or not.
