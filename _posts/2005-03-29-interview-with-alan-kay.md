This is an [interesting interview](http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=273&page=1) with Alan Kay.

> Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.

He also has some choice words for early binding

> If you're using early-binding languages as most people do, rather than late-binding languages, then you really start getting locked in to stuff that you've already done. You can't reformulate things that easily.

and the common languages today

> so both Lisp and Smalltalk can do their things and are viable today. But both of them are quite obsolete, of course. The stuff that is in vogue today is only about "one- half" of those languages.

and for computer science eductation

> but I fearâ€”as far as I can tellâ€”that most undergraduate degrees in computer science these days are basically Java vocational training.
