[TeleRead: Bring the E-Books Home Â» The Law of Computer Entropy](http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=3447) is great post about how the Law of Computer Entropy (The market for your computer product tends towards zero over time) impacts the publishing industry. Interestingly, one of the model Mr. Sperberg suggest to deal with this is &#8220;Pay once, read any book â€” free all day (all week/month/year)&#8221; is already being used by O&#8217;Reilly with their [Safari Bookself](http://safari.oreilly.com/).
