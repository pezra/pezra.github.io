In [this article](http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2005/04/coding-is-not-construction/) I proposed that coding is design and not construction. As usual I am late to the party, [Jack Reeves pointed this out 13 years ago](http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html) (thanks Charlie), it discussed extensively on c2.com ([What Is Software Design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsSoftwareDesign) and [The Source Code Is The Design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign)), and mentioned on many [blogs](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22code as design%22).

The whole thing has depressed me a bit. I think our industry would be in a lot better shape if we had internalized this idea 10 years ago. Why is it that good ideas, like this one, do not take hold? Anyway, if you have not read those essays by Jack Reeves go do it now.
