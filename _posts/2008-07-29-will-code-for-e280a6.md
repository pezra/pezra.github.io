I am no longer with [Gnip](http://gnipcentral.com). Which means that am available for other opportunities.

I know a fair bit about REST, HTTP, web services, extensible system design and scalable architecture. I like agile (small a) processes, Behavior (or test) driven development and dynamic languages. I am also pretty good at designing data interchange formats in JSON and XML. I dislike poorly factored, inelegant code. I do have a tendency to over-engineer things, but I am working on that.

If the above sounds interesting we should [talk](/blog/peter-williams#contact-info). My resume is [here](/blog/resume/).
