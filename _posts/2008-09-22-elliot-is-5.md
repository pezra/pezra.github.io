Happy Birthday Elliot! Elliot is five today. He is getting to be a very big boy now.

Last Saturday I took him to [Elitch Gardens](http://www.elitchgardens.com/). We spent a great six hours playing. You cannot go wrong with a day of sugar, video games and rides. He is big enough to ride quite a few rides there. A few of them were even entertaining for me. His favorite ride was [shipwreck falls](http://www.elitchgardens.com/shipwreckfalls.php). Getting wet has some sort of unnatural attraction for him.

This morning we started with presents. After everyone was ready for school he donned his wrist, elbow and knee pads and played with his new skate board for a few minutes. He seemed to enjoy it until he crashed into some the patio furniture. Fortunately, no real damage was done to either him or the furniture.

This evening we had dinner at the Old Spaghetti Factory with our friends [Morgan](http://www.blizzo.com/), [Amy](http://www.amysbrain.com/), Mason and Madeleine. The picture above is Elliot blowing out the candle the wait staff at the restaurant put in his ice cream.
