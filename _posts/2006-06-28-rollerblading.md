I have started roller-blading again after a two plus year absence. I had forgotten how much fun it is. I managed to escape the office for a while today and go blading on the Boulder Creek Path. Blading is like biking in the sense that you don&#8217;t really forget how to do it. So even with not having done it in a couple of years I can still have fun on my blades. I did wipe-out once today, though. I was not even doing anything interesting, I just lost my balance for no particular reason. No real damage, thankfully, just a scraped knee.

Boulder Creek Path is really nice to blade on. The scenery is beautiful and the trail is fairly flat overall but has quite a few small hills. Highly recommended.
