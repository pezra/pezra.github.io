I came across [Notes on Postmodern Programming](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/comp/Publications/CS-TR-02-9.abs.html) today. While reading it I first thought I am a post-modern programmer, then I decided that I am a modern programmer with post-modern tendencies, and finally I concluded that I am not sure which I am. :) Either way it is a fairly brilliant read with lots of food for thought.
