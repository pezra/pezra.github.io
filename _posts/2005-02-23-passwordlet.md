I happened across this [interesting little tibit](http://www.angel.net/%7Enic/passwdlet.html) yesterday. It is a bookmarklet that generates a password based on the domain name and a master password. It makes it so that you can have a different password for every website you need to logon to without having to remember hundreds of passwords.
