According to this years GITA program, <http://www.gita.org/events/annual/28/program.pdf> p. 21, I co-presented a talk about GIS XML Vocabularies. I had been planning on presenting this topic with Pedro Pacheco when we work together at GE but when I left GE I decided to let him do it without me. Apparently the program did not get updated to remove my name. Anyway, I hope it when well for Pedro.
