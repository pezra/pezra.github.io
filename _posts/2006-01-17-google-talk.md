[Google Talk is now connected to the public XMPP network](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2006/01/xmpp-federation.html)<footnote>Via [Phil Wilson](http://philwilson.org/blog/2006/01/google-talk-flips-switch.html)</footnote>, and that is a Good Thing. Now if I can only get my hosting company to provide an XMPP service so that I can could use my real email address. Until then you can contact me via XMPP at <samp>peter.e.williams@gmail.com</samp> <footnote>This is _not_ my primary email address. Please do not send email to this address.</footnote>, should you so desire.
