My son slept in his bed (as opposed to his crib) for the first time last night. We got the bed last week-end and he took a nap in it on Sunday, but he slept in his crib on Sunday night. Last night he really wanted to sleep in the bed so we let him. He did really well, by which I mean he slept through the night and did not fall out of bed. Though, given all the pillows Cat put around him I am not at all sure that it was physically possible for him to fall out of bed.

Another milestone passed. They seem to be coming quite close together these days.
