I am just finishing my first day here at [WebRoot](http://www.webroot.com). It has been an interesting day. I have learned a little of how things work here and meet some great people. You know, the usual first day sort of stuff. I cannot wait to do some real work.

For the first time in years I have an office with a door and everything. Even better my new office has a western view. That means that all day I get to look at the mountains. This picture is the best my phone can do but does not do the view justice. That is Boulder Creek you see in the foreground and the Colorado front range in the background. Maybe tomorrow I will bring a real camera so that I can gloat properly.
