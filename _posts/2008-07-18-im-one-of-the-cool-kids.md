[It was pretty surreal to watch this unfold in my inbox](http://blog.reverberate.org/2008/07/17/416-random-people-with-ror-on-their-resume-reply-all-reverse-flash-mob/). I happened to be one of the lucky 400 people to get spammed by Pradipta. The internet is a strange and wondrous place.

Reverberate seems to be having load issues so the story is: Yesterday a recruiter sent an email regarding some Ruby on Rails work to 400 people. But rather than using BCC he just sent the message to everyone. Shortly thereafter someone replied to all which, of course, went to all of us. The weird part is that it rapidly evolved into an interesting discussion amongst that group of random people brought together only by the ineptitude of a spammer. So much so that we have create [google group and a logo](http://groups.google.com/group/pradiptas-rolodex). :)
