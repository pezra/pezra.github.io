So said Elliot on the way home yesterday evening. And he was right.

We spent the morning at [Boulder Reservoir](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1267&Itemid=2105) for a [company picnic](http://absolute-performance.com). The [food](http://www.ktsbbq.com) and the [band](http://www.myspace.com/theclamdaddys) were great. And the kids had a blast playing in the water, jumping in the [bouncy castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncy_castle) and riding the boats.<sup id='e0a5e06864b0151b94791e88d95e2c2a4d4cea49fnref:1'><a href='#e0a5e06864b0151b94791e88d95e2c2a4d4cea49fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>

One the way home we noticed that there was a lot of air traffic around the [Boulder Airport](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/airport). So on a whim, we drove over to see what was up. It turned out that the [second annual Airport Day](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=7494&Item+id=2792) was going on. Both Audrey and Elliot love airplanes so it was a big hit. There were many aircraft to look at and planes and helicopters where landing and taking off very frequently. The kids were in heaven.

And then [Catherine](http://www.barelyenough.org/notablog) spotted the [glider rides booth](http://www.milehighgliding.com). They were running a special for Airport Day. So Elliot an I took a short glider ride. It is a beautiful thing. The mountains and Boulder are gorgeous from a couple of thousand feet. Elliot is pretty sure that gliders are the best thing since sliced bread, now. All in all, a spectacular way to miss nap time.

After all that excitement we did manage to get the kids to nap for an hour or so before we dropped them off at a friend&#8217;s house so that Catherine and I celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary. We had a really nice, relaxing diner at [Iron Mountain Winery](http://www.ironmountainwinery.com). Followed by some coffee and perusing in a book store.

Yep, I think &#8220;Today was such a good day.&#8221; pretty much sums it up.

        This was my first experience with peddle boats, actually. They are a bit more work operate than I expected.
