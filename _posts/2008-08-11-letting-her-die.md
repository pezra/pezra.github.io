At the [pool](http://www.broomfield.org/recreation/i/pdrc/Pool%20Area.JPG) the other day Audrey slipped off a ledge she was standing on and fell into the deep water. Her head went under water for maybe ten seconds before I was able to get to her. No sooner does she catch her breath than she says &#8220;You were going to let me dead<sup id='fnref:let-me-die:1'><a href='#fn:let-me-die:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>&#8221;, in her most accusing and disappointed voice.

If she can come up with that at this age I am a bit afraid of what she will be saying in a couple of years.

        She obviously does not always conjugate &#8220;die&#8221; correctly yet. That is not really surprising because the very concept is only a week or two old for her.
