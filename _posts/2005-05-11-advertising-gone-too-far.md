This morning there was a [story about movie marketing](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4647581) on Morning Edition. One thing they noted it that in a recent sit-com there was a paid reference to the movie ET. A sub-plot was created exclusively to advertise that movie. I already knew that most every product you see in television shows is paid advertising (I mean &#8220;product placement&#8221;) but it had never occured to me that the actual plots of television shows were for sale. Maybe I am just too naive.
