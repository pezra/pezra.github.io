    Audrey and I kayaking the Arkansas river from Stone Bridge to Salida. The river was great and Audrey had a great time once she realized that it was not scary. We had a great time playing in the river at Salida. Next time I think we will stop there to play but then continue on to Salida east because parking, etc is a little challenging in Salida proper.
