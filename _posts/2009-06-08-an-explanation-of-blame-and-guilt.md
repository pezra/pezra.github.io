I just read [Blame Turned Upside Down](http://www.evolutionofgod.net/blame)<sup id='fnref:blame-explanation-1'><a href='#fn:blame-explanation-1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> by Robert Wright. I don&#8217;t think i have ever felt quite so uncomfortable while reading as i did during that essay. Its thesis is easy to apply to daily life and it quite handily explains the reactions of myself, and others, to many situations i have experienced. It is profoundly discomforting that people&#8217;s behaviors and feelings are dominated by a set of ancient heuristics. Particularly when that person is me.
