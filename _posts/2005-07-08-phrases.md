My son Elliot started using two word phrases this week. The first one was &#8220;ma ma wa&#8221; (more water). He has been using both &#8220;ma ma&#8221; and &#8220;wa&#8221; for while but never before had he actually put two words together. It is pretty amazing to observe how children learn to talk. I am sometimes surprised that we can talk at all.
