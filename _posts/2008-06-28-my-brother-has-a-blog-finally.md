[Cat](http://pinkasparag.us/) and I have been gently suggesting that my brother should get a blog for years. Now [he has finally done it](http://chloroforminprint.org/). I am not sure what the personality<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> of his blog will turn out to be, but I am looking forward to finding out. He is smart &#8211; and a [better photographer](http://chloroforminprint.org/2008/06/18/first-light/) than I knew &#8211; so it should be good.

        I was about to say theme. That is not quite right, though. Some blogs have a theme other have more than one theme intertwined. I am not sure I am comfortable personifying blog quite that explicitly but personality does work rather well to describe what I mean.
