Today is my first on the job at [ID Watchdog](http://www.idwatchdog.com/).

After the normal pleasantries of getting a desk, etc, i had the pleasure of over hearing a conversation of some ops people in the kitchen. Apparently, a not so nice person provided the police with the identity of one of our clients rather than his own. A fact which the ID Watchdog system detected. Now the ops team is working with law enforcement and the Judaical system to cleared up the confusion. A standard part of the service we provide, apparently.

I am psyched to be working at a place that helps people in such concrete ways.
