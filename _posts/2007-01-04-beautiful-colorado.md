There are days when I am nearly overwhelmed by the beauty around me. Today is one of those days. The front range is so beautiful today I just had to share it even though my camera phone really does not do it justice.

I took this picture on my commute to work this morning. I have a longish commute, over 30 minutes each way. Most days I wish it were shorter but overall it is not that bad. It is all low stress driving and I have gorgeous views for almost the entire drive.
