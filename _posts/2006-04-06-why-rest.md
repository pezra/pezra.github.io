I am in the process of redesigning my blog. The default WordPress theme is nice and all but [Charlie](http://cfis.savagexi.com) and [Catherine](http://www.barelyenough.org/notablog) have shamed me into doing something less mundane.

One of the things that had bothered me was my blog roll. It was out-of-date because WordPress&#8217;s default way of handling links make it pretty painful to import a list of links. Actually the first time is easy and great but every time after that you just want to shoot yourself. The other problem was that the list was long and it messed up the way the page looked.

So I decided to trim the list in the side bar to just people that I know. But declarative living requires that I keep my blogroll public. So I decided to create a blogroll page (you can find the results [here](http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/blogroll/)).

Being lazy like I am, I refuse to create this page by hand. I noticed that [FeedLounge](http://feedlounge.com) can export my subscriptions as OPML.<footnote>Actually, I noticed this before I switched to  
FeedLounge. The ability to export my subscriptions is an absolute  
requirement of any aggregator I use. I would not have switched to  
FeedLounge if it did not support this.</footnote> Initially I though I would write a little ruby script that would pull down my OPML document from FeedLounge and the use [ruby-xslt](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-xslt/) to transform the OPML into and HTML document. This was a nice idea because I could have scheduled it to run every night so that blogroll would always up-to-date.

Sadly, FeedLounge completely ignores [web architecture](http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/). For example, the URI used to export a OPML is `http://my.feedlounge.com/export/opml` which does not point at _my subscriptions_ but rather to some bit of code that can generate a OPML file. This bit of code figures out who&#8217;s subscriptions to export based on, I suppose, a cookie, or something. The details do not matter because it is not something that I can reasonably duplicate in my schedulable ruby script. So instead I have to manually download the OPML file, then transform it and then push it to the server. That process does not take very long but is really annoying that I have to do it. One demerit for FeedLounge for forcing me into a manual process that could have been easily avoided.

So why use REST? Because I want to use your application in ways you have not anticipated or haven&#8217;t had the time to implement yet.
