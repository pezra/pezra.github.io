Over the week-end I made some yogurt and boy am I glad I did. It was easily the best yogurt I have ever had. It was particularly good with peaches. That was tonight&#8217;s dessert, doesn&#8217;t it look yummy?

In case you are wondering, I used a combination of [these recipes](http://www.allfreecrafts.com/giftinajar/homemade-yogurt.shtml). I did not follow either exactly. I get the feeling that is rather difficult to actually mess up yogurt.
