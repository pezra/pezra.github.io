Winter is definitely over here in Denver. This is the scene that greeted me in the kitchen when I arrived home from work today.

I created that arrangement this morning and didn&#8217;t even notice. The white bucket on a carafe is [a cold brew coffee maker](http://www.toddyproducts.com/shop/product.php?productId=67). It makes _excellent_ iced coffee. It really screams summer to me because I don&#8217;t cold brew coffee in the winter. The plants are waiting for someone to get around to putting them in the ground. Next to the plants are a cucumber and a bell pepper.

After dinner I sat back with my first cold brew coffee of the season. (After playing a few games of hopscotch, of course.)
