The current crop of phones are depressingly lame. I am currently using a [Samsung t519](http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/samsung-trace-sgh-t519/4505-6454_7-32069582.html). It has served me well for pretty close to two years now. My two biggest complaints with it are that phone allowed [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.com) to permanently hijacked the right soft button, and that is, perhaps, a tiny bit too thick. That second complaint is particularly unfortunate given the fact that I believe it to be the thinnest phone ever available in the US.

A few days ago I dropped my phone. It still works but case cracked so I decided that it was probably time for a new phone. Two years is a pretty good run for a phone. So I mossied over to my local T-Mobile kiosk to take a look at what is available. Man does the selection suck. The are all bricks with absolutely no sense of style. Hell, my very first cell phone, the [Nokia 2190](http://www.cellular-news.com/phones/Nokia_2190.php), (in 1997) looked almost as good as most of the phone available today. And it was only a little bigger.

How is it that phones have gotten less interesting, and larger, in the last two years? I guess I am not the target market for phones being produced today. If someone where to produce a _thin_ candy bar with a decent sense of style and a reasonable feature set I would definitely be interested. Until that happens I think I am just oing to continue to use my two-year-old-but-still-better-than-anything-that-is-available-today phone until it actually stops working.
