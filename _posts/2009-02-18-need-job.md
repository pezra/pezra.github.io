I am on the job market again.

If you needs some help exposing your applications functionality via REST web APIs, we should talk. If you need some assistance developing, deploying and managing a Ruby application, I have the skills you need. If you need someone that can learn your code base and your business processes, I can do that. If you need someone to drive improvements to you software development process, I won&#8217;t disappoint you.

My [resume](/resume) has more details on my skills and accomplishments. Feel free to pass it around to anyone you think might be interested.
