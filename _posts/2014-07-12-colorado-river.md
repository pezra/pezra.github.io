Elliot and I after white water kayaking on the Colorado river.

We put in at Rancho Del Rio (they have a good shuttle service) and took out at Two Bridges. It is a great stretch of river for beginners &#8212; fun and non-threatening. The flow is still good (great for this time of year) and the weather was perfect. All of that combined to make a perfect day in the Colorado outdoors.
