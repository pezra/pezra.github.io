    I got an <a href='http://www.cowonamerica.com/products/iaudio/f1/'>iAudo F1</a><br /> for Christmas and I am very pleased. It has all the features I want in<br /> a digital audio player, it is small, it plays Vorbis (OGG) natively, it<br /> plays MP3 natively and it is compatiable with Linux. As it turns out<br /> the iAudio series are about the only players on the market that have<br /> all these features, which is a little sad, but you only need one choice<br /> if it is a good one.
  </p>
  
  <h5>
    Linux Compatiability
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    The F1 works perfectly on linux. Just plug it in and mount it like any other USB flash drive<footnote>It is a vfat filesystem which Ubuntu mounts automatically by default.</footnote> and then use move, copy and delete files from it just like you would<br /> any other drive on your system. I have no idea why all USB digital<br /> music players don&#8217;t support this interface, it cannot be that hard to<br /> implement.
  </p>
  
  <h5>
    Sound Quality
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    The F1 supports a variety of formats (MP3, WMA, OGG, ASF and WAV to be exact). I have only tried OGG and MP3<footnote>So<br /> far this is only been used for two podcasts. BTW, if you know of any<br /> good technical podcasts let me know. I am not quite sure how one finds<br /> good podcasts. With blogs I use the links from blogs I already read to<br /> grow my reading list but with podcasts it does not seem to work the<br /> same way.</footnote> but they both sound quite good to my ear. The OGG playback on the F1 is notably better than the playback I get from my laptop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The F1 has a significant set of audio effect it can apply.<br /> Everything from boosting base tones to adding missing harmonics. The<br /> all seem to do approximately what is claimed. The only effect I have<br /> had trouble with is the &#8220;BBE&#8221; effect, which is suppose to make the<br /> music sound &#8220;more vivid&#8221;. When it is turned on, and it is on by<br /> default, it completely jacks up any repeating high pitched sound, like<br /> cymbals. That is not a big deal, it just took me a little while to<br /> figure out which effect was causing the problem.
  </p>
  
  <h5>
    Style and Usability
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    The F1 has a very nice OLED screen with interesting analog dials to<br /> display where in the track you are and the volume of each channel. The<br /> gauge displays are very easy to understand and and a bit unusual, which<br /> is nice. The stuff below the analog parts of the display is fairly<br /> small and hard to read except in near optimal situations. However, I<br /> rarely find that I care about that information so it does not really<br /> bother me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The overall shape of the F1 makes it comfortable to hold and<br /> operate. It is about the size of a pack of Trident gum, only a little<br /> thicker at one end. The only issue I have with the physical design is<br /> that your hand covers the screen if you try to operate the F1 with only<br /> one hand, but that probably comes with the territory for players this<br /> small. You can easily hold the player with one hand and operate the<br /> joystick with the other, which allows easy viewing of the screen.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The buttons don&#8217;t all work exactly like I think they should<footnote>For example, I think the play button should play all the contents of the selected folder but it navigate into the folder.</footnote> but over all the user interface is quite usable.
  </p>
  
  <h5>
    USB Plug
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    The only other downside to the F1 is the USB plug. The USB plug is<br /> actually a separate adapter. The F1 has two jacks on it, one for<br /> headphones and one for the USB adapter. However both jacks are<br /> identical in size. The manual stats that you should &#8220;never insert the<br /> USB adapter into the headphone jack&#8221;. I am not sure what would happen<br /> if you plugged the USB adapter into the headphone jack and into a<br /> computer but I suspect that would not be pretty. The fact that the USB<br /> and headphone jacks are the same size strikes me as an accident waiting<br /> to happen. In addition, it is inconvenient to have to carry two things<br /> around rather than just one. But so far I have had no real problems.
  </p>
  
  <h5>
    Conclusion
  </h5>
  
  <p class='summary'>
    Overall I think the iAudio F1 is a great little<br /> digital audio player. It looks and sounds good and has a great feature<br /> set. It has a few problems but none of those problems are huge or<br /> detract significantly from the daily enjoyment I get from this player.
