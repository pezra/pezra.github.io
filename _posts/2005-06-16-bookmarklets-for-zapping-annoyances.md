Maybe it is just me but I have started to really dislike reading webpages with black text on burn-your-retinas-off white background. (Yea, I know my website is this way. I am going to fix it real soon now&#8230;) I found this [site](http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/zap.html) with lots of cool bookmarklets for fixing that, and other annoyances on the web.
