It seems that if you tilt your head just the right way [software engineering has a lot in common with manufacturing](http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/What_engineering_has_in_common_with_manufacturing_and_why_it_matters). One thing I like about this idea is that it does a pretty good job of explaining why agile software development practices work.
