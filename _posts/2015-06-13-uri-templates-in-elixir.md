I just released my very first [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) package, [UriTemplate](http://github.com/pezra/ex-uri-template). It is an [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) compliant URI template processor. 

I&#8217;ve been playing with Elixir for the last few days and i really like it. I haven&#8217;t gotten into any of the concurrency stuff it really shines at yet but it is a really nice language in which it program even without that.
