Now in addition to [FooCamp](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/08/foo_camp_adhoc_.html) and [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/) there is [MindCamp](http://www.seattlemind.com/) in Seattle (via [Ted Leung](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/10/10#1395)). We should have one of these in the Denver/Boulder area. If anyone is putting together a *Camp for Denver, or even thinking about it, I would love to help out.
