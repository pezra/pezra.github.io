[Lawrence Lessig and John Hardwicke Fight Sexual Abuse and the American Boychoir School](http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index.html) is a deeply disturbing story but one well worth the reading.

Mr. Lessig speaking of the man who sexually abused him and the people who knew about it.

    "I've never felt angry, or really angry, at Hanson. Hanson's sick. He's got a disease. The real evil isn't the Hitler. The evil is the good German. The evil is all those people who could've just picked up the goddamn telephone and stopped it."

I have never been in a situation that even compares to this one but I hope that if I ever am I will do the right thing, regardless of the risks.
