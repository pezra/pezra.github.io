On my walk back to the office from lunch today I noticed the there was a small [Novo Coffee](http://www.novocoffee.com) sign in the window of the warehouse across the street. The name was familiar but I couldn&#8217;t quite place it at the time<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. Given that the [coffee I had at work was getting a bit stale](http://brightkite.com/objects/be93d6ea88c011ddb5dc003048c0801e) I decided that it was worth investigating

I went in the open door and there before my eyes was a small batch coffee roaster. Inside I meet two very nice gentlemen, Pat and Herb, who were very happy to help me. Pat showed me around the operation, and after a bit of discussion about the sort of coffees I like suggested the San Rafael. So I bought a pound and promptly went back to the office and brewed a pot using my [new kit](http://brightkite.com/objects/997b8c2a866011ddb0000030487eb504).

It is an excellent coffee. I think it might be a bit more interesting if it were roasted a bit darker<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>, but it is delicious none the less. I really like that there is an excellent coffee roaster just a block from my office. I may never have to endure stale coffee again.

        Later I remembered that they have a coffee shop at the <a href='http://www.denverartmuseum.org'>Denver Art Museum</a>. I really enjoy the espresso I had there the last time I went.

            Apparently, Novo has a very light roasting profile.
