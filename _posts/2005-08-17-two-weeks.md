Only two weeks until my daughter will be born. We still do not have a name, but everything else is just about ready. We saw our traditional two-weeks-before-the-baby-is-born concert last night. We have sorted out all of the gender neutral baby clothes we had for Elliot and are in the process of washing them (and all the new, pink frilly, clothes). We got a [double stroller](http://www.gracobaby.com/catalog/product.aspx?modelNumber=7951GGG&CategoryID=2) the other day. It is very big but I cannot imagine trying to go shopping with two, two and under, children with out one. Lots of little things still need to be done but I think we are in pretty good shape. Except for that name thing.
