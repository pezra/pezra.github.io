  <p>
    I recently read <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem' class='item url fn'>Anathem</a> by <a href='http://www.nealstephenson.com/'>Neal Stephenson</a>. Overall, I give it a <span class='rating'>4</span> out of 5 &#8211; an excellent read. It is <span class='summary'>an<br /> interesting story presented at a reasonable pace and, most<br /> importantly, it introduce me to a couple of intriguing ideas.</span> I definitely scrimped a bit on my sleep while I read it, not something I often do. Unfortunately, it does have one major flaw.

    Neal Stephenson has a gift for, or perhaps an obsession with, explaining interesting and complex math and science topics in his books. That is one of the thing I like about reading them. In &#8220;Anathem&#8221; these topics &#8211; namely <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space'>configuration spaces</a> and the <a href='http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/'>many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics</a> &#8211; are presented in appendices, but in the same voice as main story. I like this approach a bit better than when they appear in the middle of the story. It makes the material accessible without distracting from the plot.

    That major flaw I mentioned earlier&#8230; It is just too freakin&#8217; long. 935 pages to be exact. Really? He need almost a thousand pages to tell this story? It is a good story but would be a better book if it 2/3s, or better yet, half, as long. Most of Stephenson&#8217;s recent work is about this length. He must like this format. I just cannot help thinking that after he got famous his editors have gone soft and that has not improved his books.
