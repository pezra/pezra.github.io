I love the new [Envy Code R font](http://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released). It&#8217;s very clear and easy to read. I had looked at this font in the past and quite liked it. However, I need a somewhat larger font than its native size and previous releases of it did not scale very well. Fortunately, the new version (pr7) seems to scales very nicely.

Here is screen shot of &#8220;pretty&#8221; Emacs (on Ubuntu) using this beautiful font
