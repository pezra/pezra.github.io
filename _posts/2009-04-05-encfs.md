Security is a thing at my [new job](http://www.idwatchdog.com/). We follow [PCI security standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). We take great care never to have our customers sensitive information on unsecured machines. We make efforts to stay aware of the security risks in our environments.

With that in mind, i decide that storing all my work related files on my laptops in clear text was suboptimal. I have thought this same thing at pretty much every job, but i have never done anything about it before.

After a bit of research i settled on [EncFS](http://www.arg0.net/encfs) as the best mechanism to encrypt my work related data. It is an encrypted file system. Unlike most of the other encrypted file systems for Linux, EncFS does not require reserving large amounts of disk space up front. EncFS effectively lets you make a directory on an existing file system in which all the files will be encrypted. It is very easy to setup and use.

In addition to normal sorts of files, all my test and development databases need to be encrypted, also. These databases don&#8217;t contain any customer data they do contain some information that my employer would prefer not be public knowledge. When the database server starts it cannot access the database files until i provide the encryption password. Fortunately, [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is totally bad ass. It will happily start up even if it is unable to access some of the configured table spaces.<sup id='fnref:encfs-1'><a href='#fn:encfs-1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> As soon as the encrypted file system is mounted, the databases that reside in the encrypted directory instantly become available. The encryption layer does not even effect performance noticeably.<sup id='fnref:encfs-2'><a href='#fn:encfs-2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>

One thing i did think is a little weak is that encrypted file systems don&#8217;t get unmounted when the computer is put to sleep. No worries. A tiny script in `/etc/pm/sleep.d` to unmount the file system is all it takes to rectify that situation.

Now if someone steals my laptop the only thing they will be able to access are my family photos. That is a pretty nice feeling. Even better, it turned out to be very easy.

        To allow the <code>postgres</code> user to access the encrypted file system you do need to mount it with the <code>--public</code> option.

            This is light duty, single user, performance we are talking about. I wouldn&#8217;t suggest this setup for a heavy load production environment, but in development it no sweat.
