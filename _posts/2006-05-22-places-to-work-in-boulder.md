A few months ago [Mr O&#8217;Grady mused about coffee shops being good places to work](http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/001329.html).<footnote>BTW  
Stephen, when is the next [Denver Tech  
Meetup](http://www.denvertechmeetup.com/)?</footnote> In that post he mentioned that he really liked the idea that while working in a public space you might run into other technically inclined people from the area. That idea had not occured to me before but now I find it seductive.

Mr O&#8217;Grady was kind enough to included a list of his favorite places to hang out and work in downtown Denver, which was excellent. However, now that I am working in Boulder that list is of a little less use to me. So, I need some suggestions of good public spaces in which to work, eat and/or get caffeinated in Boulder. If you<footnote>Some of the local bloggers like [Ms  
Zelenka](http://www.annezelenka.com), [Mr  
King](http://www.alexking.org/), [Mr  
Snyder](http://jroller.com/page/bsnyder), [Mr  
Davis](http://www.davisworld.org/blojsom/blog/), [Mr  
Raible](http://www.raibledesigns.com/page/rd), and [Mr  
Carter](http://multipart-mixed.com/) must have some favorites, at  
least.</footnote> know of a great place to hang out, work and maybe have some interesting conversation in Boulder I would love to hear about it.
