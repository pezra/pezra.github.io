Day 4 we hit some good rapids and hiked up a beautiful slot canyon.

The little colorado was very silty and cinnamon colored. The silt is very fine and slick.

Tuna steaks with rice pilaf and squash for dinner tonight, and it was delicious.

The weather looks very monsoony so Elliot and i sleep in ledges in the cliff wall.

Fewer pictures today because the camera battery is running low and i am conserving.
