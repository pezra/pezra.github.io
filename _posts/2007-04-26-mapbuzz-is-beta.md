[Charlie Savage](http://cfis.savagexi.com/) and his team over at [MapBuzz](http://mapbuzz.com) have decided that is it time [open the doors](http://blog.mapbuzz.com/articles/2007/04/25/beta-pinatubo). MapBuzz is a great place to create and share maps. If you like maps, and really who doesn&#8217;t, go give it a try.
