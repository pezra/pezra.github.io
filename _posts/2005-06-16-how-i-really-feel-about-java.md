I realized recently that you just read my blog you might get the, incorrect, [impression](http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2005/06/why-java-is-not-my-favorite-language-%e2%80%94-reason-16/) that I [really](http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2005/06/why-java-is-not-my-favorite-language-reason-36/) [dislike](http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2005/06/why-java-is-not-my-favorite-language-%e2%80%94-reason-39/) Java. I am, fundamentally, an idealist and that makes it hard for me to ignore the rough edges and inconsistencies in any technology I use (even ones I [love](http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2005/04/ruby-backtraces/)).

I just wanted to make it clear that overall I think Java is fine. You can get certainly get stuff done in Java and it is a more productive environment than C/C++. There is no doubt that Java works (and there is a lot to be said for that), but I think it could be quite a bit better than it currently is.

So, Java is not my favorite language, but I don&#8217;t really hate it, either.
