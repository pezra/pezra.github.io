Today we visited petrified forest national park today. We started in the painted desert area of the park. What desolate, beautiful landscape.

After that we moved on to the petrified wood portion of the day. That <a HREF='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_wood'>stuff</a> is just cool. It is amazing how wood like the permineralize type is. The fully petrified type is really pretty.

The kids got their first jr ranger badges. At each national park kids can do some activities in the park and earn a badge and a patch for that park. It is a great way keep the kids engaged.

I recommend &#8220;Here comes science&#8221; by <a HREF='http://www.theymightbegiants.com/'>They might be giants</a> for your next road trip. It is excellent driving music. Oh, and the kids like it too.
