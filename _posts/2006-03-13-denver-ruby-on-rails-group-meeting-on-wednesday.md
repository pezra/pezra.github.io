This month&#8217;s [DeRailed meeting](http://webdesign.meetup.com/18/events/4873097/) is this Wednesday, March 15. The agenda looks very interesting, including a session about the differences in RoR 1.1. I missed the inaugural meeting last month but think I am going to be able to make it to this one.
